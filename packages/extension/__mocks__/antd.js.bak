    This file is disabled.

    To enable, rename to 'antd.js'.

    This file is disabled because it blocks the unit testing of components
    that use imports from the 'antd' library. It's unclear what this mock
    was originally solving for. If you find an instance where this mock
    is needed in order to get tests to work, then you're free to explore
    enabling this mock, but be aware that doing so without solving for other
    imports will break a ton of component unit tests.
