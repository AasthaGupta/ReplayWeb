# ReplayWeb Packages

ReplayWeb is comprised of the following packages:

* [@replayweb/extension](extension/) - allows you to record and playback functional tests for web applications from within Chrome browser.
* [@replayweb/testrunner](testrunner/) - allows you to feed recorded tests from the extension into webdriverio and run on the command line.
* [@replayweb/host](host/) - a native messaging host that allows the extension to communicate with the filesystem of your local machine to save files that you can push to your source repository.
